            As a frontend developer at Rocket Systems, my primary focus is on
            developing applications using React.js and TypeScript, as well as
            creating mobile applications with React Native. React.js is a
            popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, and
            TypeScript adds static typing to JavaScript, providing better code
            maintainability and catching errors early in the development
            process. n my role, I collaborate with the design and backend teams
            to translate user interface mockups and wireframes into fully
            functional and responsive web applications. I utilize my expertise
            in React.js and TypeScript to write clean, efficient, and modular
            code that adheres to industry best practices and coding standards.
