            Here developed a multi-page store with animations and slides ,
            you can see here its result when there is nothing in the stores for this have buttons to add something to the store ,
            but there is 1 but if you want to see the whole project how it works please download this code from the githab 
            and I ask you to change the key in the folder
            "src/connection/api/ProductApi" to the new key.
            and you can get the key if you go to the site "https://crudcrud.com" .
            this service gives us access to requests 100 times a day,
            but this is not a problem for us, we can just change the key and everything will work again.
            if you change the key, the fake server will be clean,
            so if you don't mind, please add product and category as you wish`,
